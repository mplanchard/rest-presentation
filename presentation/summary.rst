Takeaways
=========

The most important things to remember about REST

REST
----

* REST is an architectural pattern, not an interface specification
* HTTP was built with REST as its guiding principle

REST Servers
------------

    - Roy Fielding

* Are stateless
* Are discoverable
* Use URIs to indicate resources, not representations
* Implement a uniform interface
* Utilize content negotiation
