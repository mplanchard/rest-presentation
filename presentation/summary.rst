* Is an architectural style, not an interface specification or a protocol
* Emphasizes speed, reliability, evolution, and reuse in a network context
* Hypertext-driven [*]_
* HTTP was designed with REST as its guiding principle

    I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based interface a REST API

    -Roy Fielding

* Stateless
* Discoverable
* Resources, not representations
* Uniform interface
* Content negotiation

....

.. [*] In the context of REST, "hypertext" means content in which there is a
       "simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the
       information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton)
       obtains choices and selects actions."
