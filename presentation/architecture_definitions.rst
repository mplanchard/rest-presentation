Architectural Definitions

    We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.

    - Oscar Wilde, *The Canterville Ghost*

***************************************
Elements
***************************************

    A software architecture is defined by a configuration of architectural
    **elements** -- components, connectors, and data -- constrained in their
    relationships in order to achieve a desired set of architectural
    properties.

***************************************
Components
***************************************

    A **component** is an abstract unit of software instructions and internal
    state that provides a transformation of data via its interface

* Defined by its interface, not its implementation

***************************************
Connectors
***************************************

    A **connector** is an abstract mechanism that mediates communication,
    coordination, or cooperation among components.

***************************************
Architectural Style
***************************************

    An **architectural style** is a coordinated set of architectural constraints
    that restrict the roles/features of architectural elements and the allowed
    relationships among those elements within any architecture that conforms
    to that style
