*************
1989: The Web
*************

  + conceptualized in 1989 by Tim Berners Lee at CERN[*]_
  + A "Vague but exciting" idea, according to his boss
  + By 1990, he had written protocols for HTML, URI, and HTTP, along with ``httpd``
  + Opened to the world in 1991
  + Committed to be open source and free in 1993
  + Berners Lee moved to MIT in 1994 and founded the W3C

****************
1994: Challenges
****************

  + Release of NSCA Mosaic led to significantly increased uptake (1000x load
    on first web server)[*]_
  + Increased utilization of inline images
  + Unsuitability of single request-response architecture
  + Web architects worried about collapse due to load and poor network
    scalability of early HTTP

*********
Solutions
*********

  + IETF working groups on URI, HTTP, and HTML tasked with establishing
    new standards
  + Roy Fielding led specification for Relative URL, co-authored HTTP 1.0,
    led HTTP 1.1, and authored revisions to URL specifications to create
    generic URI syntax
  + REST developed from 1994-1995 and applied to those standards
